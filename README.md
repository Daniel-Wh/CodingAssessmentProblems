# CodingInterviewPractice

##  What's the Point?
This repository is meant to be a tool to help centralize interview problems and answers for Southwestern University students.

## How You Can Help

If you see a more optimal solution to any of the problems we've solved, we'd love to hear about it and understand why, so please submit a pull request.

## Requirements for a Pull Request
It's not good enough to have a collection of answers, if you don't understand why the answer works, please don't submit a PR. 

Feel free to answer the problem in the language that you feel most comfortable in. If a folder doesn't exist for your language, add one and place your file within the folder.

Some of the problems can be grouped, check to make sure someone hasn't already started a file with similar problems.
Aside from that, happy coding and good luck.
